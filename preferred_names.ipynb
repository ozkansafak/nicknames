I'm a conscientious and personable finance/accounting professional with 15+years experience across a variety of industries. I have an established history of partnering with small business owners and organizational leaders, providing financial guidance and expertise across a wide range of financial responsibilities. Most recently, I managed a portfolio of private equity investments, providing a full range of accounting and financial analysis responsibilities as a fractional CFO/Controller.  I'm currently collaborating with a relatively new company attempting to use the broad knowledge I've obtained over the past two decades in business valuation, financing and financial markets, project management, and private equity transactions to help small business owners in their succession planning and their ultimate exit from their business.  I'm a dedicated father of two great kids, a passionate volunteer baseball coach and a decent piano player. I'm a native of Southeastern Ohio/West Virginia even though I've spent most of the last twenty plus years in North Carolina. I'm a diehard Wake Forest sports fan and I'm tirelessly attempting to figure out how in the world I'm going to afford to send my kids to the greatest school on the planet. Go Deacs!  Here are a few of the testimonial letters from some of my clients:  Testimonial #1The thought of selling our business felt like wading into murky waters – we were apprehensive and quite frankly didn’t even know the right questions to ask. However, after meeting with Andy Holtgrewe, we were immediately put at ease. He completed a thorough market evaluation of our business and walked us through it step-by-step. He answered all our questions in layman’s terms and gave us a clear assessment of the value of our business and what to expect every step of the way. In short, we would highly recommend Andy to anyone considering the end game of selling their business. He was able to simplify an exceptionally complex environment and gave us the peace of mind to make some very big decisions based on a clear and complete picture. Thanks again for your expertise and exceptional customer care!  Dennis  Testimonial #2  For the record, of the brokers we have spoken to over the years, you rank in the top few for attentiveness and knowledge. Your sellers are lucky to have hired you to represent them. You are doing a very fine job  .Craig (Buyer)  Testimonial #3  We would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew Holtgrewe for the superb handling of the listing, sale and closing of our business located in Southwest Virginia.As a small business in a rather niche market we were most concerned as to the prospects of locating a skilled business broker that could handle our needs. Our accountant and other business executives in our area highly recommended your company that specializes in the sale and acquisition of companies that are under $2M in annual gross sales volumes.To our amazement, the entire transaction from the initial sales listing agreement through the actual closing took just 64 days! Simply incredible!Within a few weeks of completing the construction of our retirement home in another state, I had been diagnosed with an incurable cancer. With Chemo and Radiation Therapy treatments it made it extremely difficult to virtually impossible to make trips regarding the numerous details involved in the sale of our business.Andrew Holtgrewe dove right in from the very beginning in making a trip to our home located in a State different from your offices and in making many trips to the actual business site during both the due diligence and closing phases of the sale. Andrew stayed in constant contact with us both night and day and in many instances through Saturdays and Sundays to assist both the sellers and the Purchaser in obtaining any and all information that was pertinent to the sale. Andrew Holtgrewe is simply a true credit to both your company and entire industry.  John Bachorik-AutoMaster Tire and Service  Testimonial #4  We just wanted to express how much we enjoyed and appreciated working with you on one of your recent business opportunities.

      "Bradley Henke is a  business broker of the well-known  Goldstone Realty business brokerage company who helps people sell their business in ND and nearest regions. Brad- I have a diverse background. I am a veteran, having served in the US Army. After my enlistment, I moved home, but missed traveling. I got into construction and spent years in the construction industry and traveled the country. I eventually settled in Mississippi and opened a business as a contractor. I moved back home to North Dakota in 2006, and feeling called to finally pursue my education later in life. Hard work has never scared me, so I attended college while working full-time, and obtained my degree in finance. I also managed to meet my wife during this time, and we were married in 2011.  As a professional, I worked for over four years in the field of human resources, and honed a valuable skill set in communication and interaction, as well as helping to make me a more well-rounded person. I then pursued and acquired a role in corporate business development, I gained vast knowledge and skills in analysis, property valuation, business valuation, and financial forecasting. I valuated businesses, made recommendations to the executives on whether to buy, and was part of the team who performed due diligence and executed the acquisition. I also remained involved post-acquisition to help the newly acquired company become a part of our corporate family. My time there was invaluable, and I enjoyed it immensely.  Although I enjoyed and am grateful for my opportunities in the professional world, I only feel true purpose and satisfaction working to build something of my own. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to help others, and with my background in construction, HR, finance, and business development, real estate was the perfect option. My wife and I formed Henke Homes, Inc. and joined our friend and mentor at Goldstone Realty.   The experiences I've had in the construction and professional world, combined with the education I've received, have given me unique insight and understanding of the industry. This has allowed me to be a valuable resource for clients. I research and verify information I provide, and will find an accurate answer for your questions when I am unsure, this has allowed me to help clients make well informed decisions regarding their valued assets.\n",

Jason \"Jay\" started working at an Italian restaurant at a young age. Five years and 12 academic scholarships later, he did it again, graduating #1 in his class with a Bachelor's degree in Economics/International Business at the University of Southern Mississippi. Along the way he attained numerous accolades, including earning the prestigious \"Collegiate Entrepreneur of the Year\" Award. He founded \"The Green Street Journal,\" a student-driven newsletter for the College of Business which has now been endowed and is not only published for business students, but has also become an important source of current news and information for alumni of the College of Business. He studied abroad in the U.K. and served as President of the National Association for Business Economics, President of Omicron Delta Epsilon (an Economics Fraternity), and President of Beta Gamma Sigma (an honorary business fraternity), served on the Business Student Advisory Council and others. Immediately after college he moved to the booming city of Las Vegas, NV and worked as an analyst for a men's tie company. Meanwhile he studied for his Series 7 Stock Broker License, which he obtained and became a financial advisor with American Express Financial Advisors (now Ameriprise Financial). Jay became the go-to guy for new advisors, as he held the highest conversion rates in the Arizona/Las Vegas market group and enjoyed helping junior advisors learn to be effective in sales and comfortable connecting with people in their own voice. He took all of the awards available to advisors, including multiple awards for sales performance and was among the top 5% of producers in financial planning and insurance sales. But he is most proud of receiving the President's Award for Quality of Advice, an award granted to about 5% of advisors and based on peer-reviewed financial plans and reflects a commitment to providing the highest quality of advice to clients. He sold the business to two senior advisors and took on the challenge of becoming the first Corporate Business Coach at Action International, the world's largest business coaching franchise. As a business coach he had the unique opportunity to work with other entrepreneurs who wanted to achieve more of their life's goals through business, and he carved out a niche in his business as an expert at developing creative ways to help business owners market themselves with little or no money, as well as make a significant and sustainable impact to the bottom line. In this capacity he had the opportunity to provide feedback to new coaches during training and provide feedback to the executive team about what was effective in terms of marketing coaching services to potential new clients as well as staying on top of major areas of concern for existing clients.He has worked with hundreds of clients (possibly over a thousand) toward reaching their goals through troubleshooting their businesses and making them more profitable, through consulting them through buying businesses and franchises, and through the sales and acquisition of real estate and 1031 exchange properties. His broad knowledge and diverse hands-on experience, in the areas of sales, marketing, finance, management and operations, as well as hand-on experience with branding, technology, business planning, strategic planning, funding and business start-up, growth and development in various industries including the entertainment industry, hospitality/restaurant, tech/the Internet, Web development, Social Networking and now the Wireless Web, makes Jay a significant asset to clients.\n",

Through their experiences- my passion for the industry burns bright. I am here to serve the restaurant and hospitality community for many years to come.”  LeAnna has a passion for the food and beverage industry that started at a very young age. “Growing up in an Italian American home- my family revolved around coming together for food. And not just to eat… but the sourcing and preparation of food fill so many of my childhood memories.” Her family owns several Italian restaurants and pizzerias throughout New England where she cut her teeth before moving to Las Vegas to be formally trained in the F&B and hospitality industry. “I couldn’t think of a better place to set my standards in the business. Las Vegas exudes hospitality from every angle.” It wasn’t long before LeAnna’s entrepreneurial spirit emerged and she was ready to blaze a new trail and open a restaurant showcasing her families’ recipes partnered with her gold standards in hospitality. Finding the right location was not an overnight process but when she made her first trip to Georgia she fell in love with its Southern charm. “I was pleased to see a slower pace and when someone spoke to me they had this refreshingly organic smile. And that’s when I knew… this was home.” Equipped with the experience opening several Vegas restaurants, she relocated to open Popi. Her experience didn’t completely prepare her for what happened when the economy starting suffering shortly after build out. There were significant delays in construction that postponed opening quite a bit. The new business sales were no match for the high lease rate and despite her best efforts, Popi was forced to close. She knew she wasn’t alone when she drove around Forsyth County and saw the partially constructed and vacant strip malls. “I wish I knew then what I know now….” and that’s when her fire for commercial real estate sparked.\n",

Members of the Business Community;  Buying or selling a business is very exciting. At times, it is also very complex and challenging. The process can be fast and thrilling one day, but frustrating the next. I know both sides of this roller coaster. In my career, I have bought and sold many businesses as Treasurer and Corporate Development Officer of public and private companies. Due to this experience, I came to Transworld generally skeptical of business brokerage and franchise sales. However, I found a company that was professional, experienced, and was led by a service philosophy beyond compare. Sharing this common ground, I joined the team by purchasing Transworld Business Advisors of Indiana.  Since its inception in 1979, Transworld has specialized in the purchase and sale of businesses, mergers and acquisitions and franchising in the Southeastern market. Today Transworld has taken that same service philosophy across the country and into International markets. Our Indiana philosophy is no different. The core of our Mission Statement “attentively listen and professionally serve the business community” reflects the same sentiment of Transworld’s “helping good people do good deals.”  If you share this same philosophy, I would like to invite you to contact our Transworld Advisors and speak with us regarding the process of buying or selling a business, franchise consulting, or becoming a team member. Our team of Advisors provide decades of experience, buying, selling and operating both large and small companies. Let our wealth of experience help you manage that roller coaster ride to a successful outcome.  I would appreciate the opportunity to listen and serve you on the essentials of buying, selling, franchising, or valuing a business.

      "MJ Cassner is a  business broker of the well-known  Transworld Business Advisors business brokerage company who helps people sell their business in NE and nearest regions. I have owned businesses and have a passion and heart for business owners. When a person pours out his or her blood, sweat, and tears for a business, that person deserves to be compensated for their work. The same is true for buyers. If a person wants to be in business, he or she deserves to feel excited about it and make a great income growing it. I also enjoy matching buyers with starting new franchises, and helping business owners turn their businesses into franchises.  Previous to business brokering and ownership, I owned a business for 11 years and was a teacher. My husband, David, and I have four children; three grown and one teen at home. David works the biz with me, has a background in sales, military recruiting, and pastoring. Great career combo for this field! We also run a 501c3 with a mission to alleviate poverty for families in Africa and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n",

      "Michael Berry is a Carmel business broker of the well-known  Transworld Business Advisors Of Indiana business brokerage company who helps people sell their business in Carmel, IN and nearest regions. Members of the Business Community;  Buying or selling a business is very exciting.  At times, it is also very complex and challenging. The process can be fast and thrilling one day, but frustrating the next. I know both sides of this roller coaster. In my career, I have bought and sold many businesses as Treasurer and Corporate Development Officer of public and private companies.  Due to this experience, I came to Transworld generally skeptical of business brokerage and franchise sales. However, I found a company that was professional, experienced, and was led by a service philosophy beyond compare.  Sharing this common ground, I joined the team by purchasing Transworld Business Advisors of Indiana.  Since its inception in 1979, Transworld has specialized in the purchase and sale of businesses, mergers and acquisitions and franchising in the Southeastern market.  Today Transworld has taken that same service philosophy across the country and into International markets.  Our Indiana philosophy is no different. The core of our Mission Statement “attentively listen and professionally serve the business community” reflects the same sentiment of Transworld’s “helping good people do good deals.”  If you share this same philosophy, I would like to invite you to contact our Transworld Advisors and speak with us regarding the process of buying or selling a business, franchise consulting, or becoming a team member.  Our team of Advisors provide decades of experience, buying, selling and operating both large and small companies.  Let our wealth of experience help you manage that roller coaster ride to a successful outcome.  I would appreciate the opportunity to listen and serve you on the essentials of buying, selling, franchising, or valuing a business.  Sincerely,  Mike Berry, President Transworld Business Advisors of Indiana\n",

I can relate to what it takes to run and grow a business; knowing what it is like to sell “my baby” after nursing it through the difficult times and being married to it for so many years. My first major business sale was when I sold a Dodge dealership that I owned and operated for 15 years, after that I spent 20 years owning and operating the Greater Quad City Auto Auction where we represented and sold vehicles for many national customers including the nation’s leading auto manufacturers on a regular basis. There comes a time when we have to move on, either to retirement, or a different life style and I decided to sell that business in 2000. After selling the auction business I opened the Sunbelt Office in Moline in March 2002. Since 2003, Sunbelt’s Moline office with its team of licensed professional business brokers has been the leader in the business brokerage/merger and acquisition field in the Quad City Iowa and Illinois region. The International Business Brokers Association has conferred me with a “CBI” Certified Business Intermediary designation as a result of successfully completing training and demonstrated standards of performance as a business broker.

      "Our closure rate is double the national average. How? We offer fair valuations, rigorous process and straight advice. Sure, we could list every business that comes our way. But we don’t. We list businesses we can sell. Good for you and good for us. There’s more, however. As you look to sell your business, you certainly will have questions. How can I get a fair price for my business? How can I sell and still protect my legacy? How do I deal with family members still in the business? What will happen to my business once I sell? How does this fit into my succession plan? What resources are available to assist in the sale of my business? Think about what keeps you awake at night. Together, we can get you through all of it from consideration to completion of sale. About Pat McAdams I grew up in a family-run business. Growing it into a seven-location operation wasn’t easy. And, neither was the decision to sell it. Most of my 27-year career has been in small business—the last 14 years spent building and then selling a Budget Blinds franchise. I found my passion, however, helping other entrepreneurs sell their businesses. And, now I’m bringing that passion to Murphy Business. Why? My experience selling my own business made me realize there were few companies helping small business owners value and prepare their business for sale, find buyers, and close the deal. Even fewer offer fair valuations and unvarnished advice to ensure your valuable time isn’t wasted chasing false expectations. On a personal note, I enjoy spending time with my wife Amy, son Riley, and daughter Mara. Hobbies include golfing, reading, fishing, boating, and cooking. Amy and I are huge fans of the Milwaukee Brewers, Milwaukee Bucks, Green Bay Packers, and Wisconsin Badgers. We also love attending and supporting high school athletics. I’m an alum of the University of Wisconsin Whitewater, where I earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Office Systems (Information Technology), leading to seven years as an IT consultant for Fortune 1000 companies.\n",
